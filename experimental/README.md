The various files in this directory represent various experiments.
Some of them are further wrappers of Windows interfaces, while some 
are classes or other things that try to exercise the various interfaces
that are available in TINN proper.

In many cases, they just offer additional looks into how to perform
certain ffi operations, or how to deal with some tricky Win32 API.

They are good to look at, and might actually be useful in fact.
